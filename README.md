# Equinet Eth Global 2024 Hackathon - RWAs, World Coin and Compliant Security Token Offerings
For the EthGlobal Sydney 2024 Hackathon!  

## My Main Goal

Security Tokens, Real World Assets and Worldcoin proof of person.

- Combine T-REX standard (EIP 3643 - https://www.erc3643.org/) with worldcoin id
- EIP3643 has a set of contracts for identity verification which we can combine with combination of attestations and worldcoin nullifiers and proofs


## Inspiration for this project


## What did I build?
- Deployed T-REX standard (EIP 3643) token
- Integrate T-REX with Worldcoin
- Created dummy attestation app
